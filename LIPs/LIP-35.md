## Abstract

This proposal describes a bundle of LIPs that increases the number of decimal places of precision supported in the percentage math operations of the Minter contract, which allows changing the `inflationChange` parameter to a lower value than currently possible (from 3 to .5). This effectively slows down the rate at which Livepeer inflation changes.

## Specification

LIPs included in the bundle are:

LIP-34: inflationChange Parameter Update
LIP-40: Minter Math Precision

## Specification Rationale

LIP-34 and LIP-40 are bundled because 
- LIP-34 is impossible to implement without LIP-40
- The added optionality provided through LIP-40 of having greater decimal places of precision in the Minter contract does not provide sufficient benefit on its own to warrant a community vote at this time

The community can evaluate this parent LIP to determine whether to accept or reject LIP-34 and LIP-40 as a bundle.
