# LIPs

Livepeer Improvement Proposals (LIPs) describe standards and protocol specifications for the Livepeer protocol.

2. Add your LIP to the fork of the repository in the directory `LIPS` directory using the [template LIP here](LIP-X.md).
3. Submit a pull request to this repository.

The first PR should contain the first draft of an LIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new LIP and assign it a number before merging it.

## LIP Types

There are three types of LIPs:

- A **Standard Track LIP** describes any changes that affect the Livepeer protocol. Currently, these changes are focused around the Ethereum smart contracts and clients
that interact with the contracts. However, in the future Standard Track LIPs may be further categorized to capture other components of the Livepeer protocol such as
the networking protocol.
- An **Informational LIP** provides general guidelines or information to the Livepeer community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational LIPs do not
necessarily represent Livepeer community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational LIPs or follow the outlined advice.
- A **Meta LIP** describes processes surrounding Livepeer including proposals to change processes. Examples of processes that could be described in Meta LIPs are
decision-making processes used in the governance around future Livepeer protocol upgrades and tools/environments used in Livepeer development.

## LIP Statuses

- **Draft**: a LIP that is open for consideration.
- **Accepted**: a LIP that is planned for immediate adoption (i.e. expected to be included in an upcoming protocol upgrade).
- **Final**: a LIP that has been adopted in a previous protocol upgrade.
- **Deferred**: a LIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption, but maybe reconsidered in the future for a subsequent protocol upgrade.
- **Rejected**: a LIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption, and will not be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent protocol upgrade.
